Some key code editor features include:

* Code editor: where you write JavaScript statements.
* Scripts tab: save the JavaScript code for your Google Earth Engine programs.
* Map: web map to visualise spatial data.
* Docs: lists all the in-built functions and operations.
* Console: print results from analysis and metadata.
* Inspector tab: interactive query of spatial objects on the map.
* Geometry tools: digitise vector features to use in your Google Earth Engine programs.
* Run: Run your script.

## Working with the GEE Map

We will start the practical exercise by working with the GEE map interface.

### Searching for a Place

Letâ€™s start by setting the map so that it shows the Kalbarri, Western Australia. In the **Search for places or datasets** box at the top of GEE, start typing in **Kalbarri** and you will see **Kalbarri** suggested under **PLACES**. Click on it and the map will centre on the Kalbarri.

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/kalbarri-map.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption>The GEE Map centered on Kalbarri</figcaption>
</figure>

In the upper right of the map display are **Map** and **Satellite** buttons. This changes the basemap from Google Maps style to a satellite image. Click on **Satellite** to change the basemap. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/kalbarri-satellite-gee-map.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption>The GEE Map centered on Kalbarri</figcaption>
</figure>

You can use the **Zoom** tool in the map window to zoom in and out, and click and drag the map to change the view. However, we want to set the location and zoom level in our script so the map will always be placed at the study area when we run the script.

## Zoom

```js
// 1. set the zoom
// Change the argument to setZoom to illustrate how you can programmatically control the Map.
Map.setZoom(12);
```

Before you continue any further, let's save the script. Click the **Save** button and enter the **File Name** as **tc-seroja-building-damage.js** and click *OK*.

## Centre the Map

```js
// 2. Centre the map at a location
// Create a point object.
var kalbarriPoint = ee.Geometry.Point([114.16361565669752, -27.71407018883071]);

```

```js
// Centre the map on the point object.
Map.centerObject(kalbarriPoint, 12);
```

## Geographic Data - Raster

### Images

An `Image` comprises one or more bands of raster objects. 

```js
// 3. Images
// Load a Planet Scope 4 Image. 
// Print to the console - explore Image metadata.
var ps4Img = ee.Image("users/jmad1v07/morethanmaps/ps4-median-composite");
print(ps4Img);
```

We can relate values in `Image` pixels to colour on the display to visualise features in an `Image`. This image contains reflectance in red, green, and blue bands so we can map it to the display to create an RGB composite (true colour composite).

```js
// Center the map and zoom in on Kalbarri.
// Rescale raster (Image) data.
// Visualise raster (Image) data.
Map.centerObject(kalbarriPoint, 16);

ps4Img = ps4Img.divide(10000); 
var ps4VisParams = {
  'bands': ['b3', 'b2', 'b1'],
  'min':-0.0198,
  'max':0.2067
};
Map.addLayer(ps4Img, ps4VisParams, 'PS4 Image');
```

Note the `//` - this is a comment which is reference text for you. It is not executed in your program. 

### ImageCollections

An `ImageCollection` is a stack of `Image`s. 

```js
//4. ImageCollection - stack of Images.
var ps4ImgColl = ee.ImageCollection('users/jmad1v07/morethanmaps/kalbarri-ps4-tc-seroja');
print(ps4ImgColl);
```

Operations that can be applied to `ImageCollection`s:

* Filter - select `Image`s based on a conditions.
* Reduce - summerise `Image`s within an `ImageCollection`. 
* Mapping - map a function over all `Image`s within an `ImageCollection`. 

#### Filter an ImageCollection

Selecting `Image`s from an `ImageCollection` based on a condition. 

```js
// 5. Filter Images pre TC Seroja
var ps4PreTCSeroja = ps4ImgColl
    .filterDate('2021-01-01', '2021-04-09');
print('Images pre-TC Seroja:', ps4PreTCSeroja);
```

#### Reduce an Image Collection

Summarise all `Image`s in the `ImageCollection`. Here, we take the median value across all `Image`s and pixels in the `ImageCollection`.

```js
// 6. Reducer
// Median reducer
// divide by 1000 to rescale PS4 image to reflectance
var ps4PreTCSerojaMedian = ps4PreTCSeroja.median().divide(10000);
print('pre-TC Seroja - median Image:', ps4PreTCSerojaMedian);
```

```js
// Visualise reduced image
// visualise parameters
var medianVisParams = {
  'bands': ['b3', 'b2', 'b1'],
  'min': 0,
  'max': 0.25
};
Map.addLayer(ps4PreTCSerojaMedian, medianVisParams, 'PS4 Image - pre-TC Seroja');

```
## Geographic Data - Vector

Vector data represents geographic features as geometric objects (points, lines, and polygons).

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/vector-data.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption>Vector data: point, lines, and polygons for representing geographic features.</figcaption>
</figure>

Positional information is represented as coordinates. Non-spatial attribute information is used to describte geographic features associated with coordinates. 

### Geometry Objects

Geometric features in Google Earth Engine are stored as `Geometry` objects. The `ee.Geometry.Point()` function takes an array of coordinates and returns a `Point` `Geometry` object. 

```js
// 7. Geometry
// Vector data - point
var kalbarriPoint =  ee.Geometry.Point([114.16361565669752, -27.71407018883071]);
print('Kalbarri Point:', kalbarriPoint);
Map.addLayer(kalbarriPoint, {color: 'blue'}, 'Point');
```

### Features

`Feature` objects in Google Earth Engine combine geographic locations (as `Geometry` objects) with a `Dictionary` object of non-spatial attribute information. `Dictionary` objects store this information in `name:value` pair format. 

```js
// 8. Feature
// Features combine geographic coordinates with a Dictionary object of Feature properties. 
var kalbarriFeature = ee.Feature(kalbarriPoint, {name: 'Kalbarri'});
print('Kalbarri Feature:', kalbarriFeature);
```

### FeatureCollections

`FeatureCollections` store a collection of `Feature`s. Similar to `ImageCollection`s there are operations to filter and reduce `FeatureCollections`. Executing the following code will render a `FeatureCollection` of building footprints from Microsoft's Building Footprints layer on the Map display. 

```js
// 9. Feature Collection - Building Footprints
var buildingFootprints = ee.FeatureCollection('users/jmad1v07/morethanmaps/microsoft_building_footprints');
print('Building Footprings:', buildingFootprints);
Map.addLayer(buildingFootprints, {}, 'Building Footprints');
```

## Remote Sensing

See the main workshop page for detailed notes on key remote sensing concepts.

### Image Bands

Use the *inspector* tab to explore pixel values for `Image`s displayed on the map. The pixel values are in units of spectral reflectance. 

Click at a location on the map and look in the *Inspectors* tab. Under the *PS4 Image - pre-TC Seroja* `Image` you should see four numbers printed against properties labelled `b1`, `b2`, `b3`, and `b4`. These numbers are the surface reflectance values recorded by the sensor in different wavelengths:

* `b1`: blue visible light
* `b2`: green visible light
* `b3`: red visible light
* `b4`: near-infrared light

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/inspector-tab.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption><em>Inspector</em> tab.</figcaption>
</figure>

`b1`, `b2`, `b3`, and `b4` are the names of `Image` bands. Surface reflectance values for the same location but different wavelengths are stored in a separate band. Each band is a raster dataset - values are stored in pixels.

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/kalbarri-reflectance-values.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption>Surface reflectance values in the four bands of a Planet Scope 4 <code>Image</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Single Image Band

Visualise surface reflectance values for a single band on the map. Let's map surface reflectance in the visible blue wavelengths.

```js
// 10. Blue band surface reflectance
var ps4Blue = ps4PreTCSerojaMedian.select('b1');
Map.addLayer(ps4Blue, {min:0, max: 0.4}, 'PS4 Blue Band');
```

<details>
  <summary><b>Which objects have the highest reflectance in the blue band, and why?</b></summary>
  <p><br>House roofs appear brightest on the map which indicates they have the highest reflectance values. This makes sense, roofs are typically smooth shiny surfaces that will reflect incoming sunlight.</p>
</details>

<br>

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/kalbarri/kalbarri-ps4-blue-band-reflectance.png" class="workshop-img">
    <figcaption>Surface reflectance values in the blue band of a Planet Scope 4 <code>Image</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

As mentioned above, different surfaces have different levels of reflectance at different wavelengths. In other words, different surface objects have different spectral reflectance characteristics which we can use to distinguish objects or features in a satellite image.

Use the *Layers* selector to bring the image *PS4 Image - pre-TC Seroja* onto the map display. Then head to the *Inspector* tab, click on a water pixel, and then click on the chart symbol next to the layer name. This will allow you visualise pixel values in a bar chart.

Click on pixels of different surface cover types such as buildings, roads, and vegetation. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Can you spot common patterns in the spectral reflectance of pixels of different cover types?</b></summary>
  <p><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Water absorbs incoming solar radiation and has low levels of reflectance. Water is particularly absorbant in near-infrared wavelengths.</li>
    <li>Green vegetation has high levels of reflectance in the near-infrared band (band 4) compared to the visible wavelengths.</li>
    <li>Building roofs have higher levels of surface reflectance in all wavelengths as they are smooth reflective surfaces.</li>
    <li>Bare earth areas have lower levels of reflectance than shiny roofs, and in the visible bands there is more reflectance in the red band (band 3). This is why the bare earth has a reddish colour.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</details>

## Mapping Building Damage

Now we will use the data and skills learned so far to develop a program that can map building damage following Tropical Cyclone Seroja from satellite images. 

Display a high spatial resolution Nearmap aerial `Image` after Tropical Cyclone Seroja struck Kalbarri to see where building damage occurred. 

```js
// 11. High-resolution Nearmap image
var nmKalbarriSeroja = ee.Image("users/jmad1v07/morethanmaps/kalbarri-nearmap-tcseroja");
print(nmKalbarriSeroja);
Map.addLayer(nmKalbarriSeroja, {}, 'Nearmap post-TC Seroja');
```

<details>
  <summary><b>How do you think the surface reflectance of a roof will change if it has been damaged during Tropical Cyclone Seroja?</b></summary>
  <p><br>We might expect there to be a decrease in surface reflectance compared to it's pre-damaged state. The cyclone damage will make the roof surface rougher, incoming solar radiation will be reflected equally in all directions with less energy being directly reflected to the satellite-sensor. This will be our working hypothesis. We'll expect that damaged roofs will show a decrease in surface reflectance compared to their pre-damaged state and undamaged roofs will have similar levels of surface reflectance before and after the storm.
  </p>
</details>

## Change Detection - Identifying Damaged Roofs

Change detection is an image analysis technique where two images of the same location, but captured on different dates, are compared to identify change in surface reflectance which can be related to actual change on the Earth's surface. 

First, we need to create a post-Tropical Cyclone Seroja `Image`. 

```js
// 12. post TC Seroja
var ps4PostTCSerojaMedian = ps4ImgColl
    .filterDate('2021-04-12', '2021-04-19')
    .median()
    .divide(10000);
Map.addLayer(ps4PostTCSerojaMedian, ps4VisParams, 'PS4 Image - post-TC Seroja');

```

Then, we can divide the pre-Tropical Cyclone Seroja  `Image` with the post-event `Image` to create a change map. 

```js
// Change building image
var change = ps4PreTCSerojaMedian.divide(ps4PostTCSerojaMedian);
Map.addLayer(change.select('b1'), {min: 0.8, max: 1.4, palette:['00ffff', 'ffff00', 'ff0000']}, 'Change Image');
```

You should see a similar `Image` to the below figure on your map display. Areas in red correspond to locations where there is a decrease in surface reflectance in the blue band after Tropical Cyclone Seroja. 

### Focus on Buildings

We're only interested in damage to buildings. Let's clip our change `Image` to just the building footprint extents to emphasise damage to roofs.

```js
// 13. builing damage
var buildingDamage = change.clip(buildingFootprints);
Map.addLayer(buildingDamage.select('b1'), {min: 0.8, max: 1.4, palette:['00ffff', 'ffff00', 'ff0000']}, 'Building Damage');
```
Turn off all layers except the *Building Damage* layer and the *Nearmap post-TC Seroja* layer. Compare the areas in red shades, which indicate a decrease in surface reflectance, to the high-resolution Nearmap `Image`. Do the areas with decreased surface reflectance correspond to buildings with damaged roofs?

## Mapping Roof Texture - Identifying Damaged Roofs

Can we identify damaged roofs when we only have a post-event `Image`. This is often the case if an `Image` is tasked after an event has occurred. 

Let's see if we can create a map of roof texture or roughness and see if that corresponds to sites of damage. 

Clip the high resolution Nearmap `Image` to the building extents. 

```js
// 14. High-resolution roofs
var highResRoof = nmKalbarriSeroja.clip(buildingFootprints);
Map.addLayer(highResRoof, {}, 'Nearmap - high-res roofs');
```

### Create a roof texture Image

This will convert the Nearmap RGB `Image` into a texture `Image` using the red bands. Higher values will indicate a rougher surface.  

```js
// 15. Compute roof roughness
var square = ee.Kernel.square({radius: 4});
var roofTexture = highResRoof.entropy(square).reproject('EPSG:32750', null, 0.5);
Map.addLayer(roofTexture.select('b3'), {min: 3, max: 4.5, palette:['00ffff', 'ffff00', 'ff0000']}, 'Nearmap - roof texture');
```

Explore the roof roughness `Image` on the map display and see if you can spot patterns between roof texture and building damage. 

<details>
  <summary><b>Can you identify any strengths or weaknesses of detecting building damage using a single high-resolution <code>Image</code> compared to pre- and post-<code>Image</code> change detection?</b></summary>
  <p><br>The finer spatial resolution pixels of the Nearmap <code>Image</code> means that small-scale damage to roofs can be detected which might not be captured in the coarse spatial resolution Planet Scope 4 <code>Image</code>s. However, features on roofs such as solar panels create a rough texture which could be conflated with building damage. If the solar panels were not affected by the cyclone, then roof damage detection using pre- and post-cyclone images for change detection should not be affected be complex roofs.
