title: Ba Livelihoods

# Introduction

This workshop will introduce how people living in coastal Fiji use a range of coastal and terrestrial ecosystems to support their livelihoods. It will also demonstrate how these ecosystems are affected by a range of climatic stressors including severe tropical cyclones to seasonal hot and dry spells. Through their effects on ecosystems people use, climatic stressors exert a large impact on people's livelihoods in this region. 

This workshop will focus on the Ba Mangroves area in Northern Viti Levu, Fiji. People living in communities surrounding the Ba Mangroves rely on a range of ecosystems including mangroves to collect crabs, other marine life, and firewood; freshwater and ocean fishing; farming; and labouring on larger sugarcane farms. 

A range of climatic stressors affect these ecosystems. The strong winds and heavy rains of tropical cyclones damage mangroves and fruit trees, flood farms, and prevent people from fishing. The Ba Mangroves are frequently in the path of tropical cyclones; in 2016 Tropical Cyclone Winston causes severe damage to ecosystems and infrastructure in the Ba area. The Ba region is also affected by flooding caused by heavy rain and exacerbated by land cover change in the upper reaches of the catchment. Following the cyclone season, the dry season brings dry periods, drought, and extreme heat events that affect crops and people when they're working on the land or collecting marine life in coastal areas. 



## Learning Objectives

* Develop an understanding of the importance of ecosystem services for livelihoods.
* Develop an understanding of how satellite images can be used to monitor change in vegetation condition after a climatic shock. 
* Learn a technique to combine satellite images and socio-economic data to understand how climate impacts to mangroves and other ecosystems affect people.
* Develop an understanding of how climate impacts to mangroves and other ecosystems affect livelihoods.

# Responding to Climate Impacts

# Causal Loop Diagrams

You have been presented with lots of information: the variety of climate impacts to ecosystems in the Ba region, the numerous ways people use ecosystems to support their livelihoods, and the different response and adaptation strategies people deploy to cope when climate impacts occur. This data is unstructured and unwieldy. This makes it hard to analyse and use in addressing important questions such as who is vulnerable to climate impacts? and, what adpatation strategies will be most effective?

To synthesise complex and unstructured data, researchers use causal loop diagrams. Causal loop diagrams are models that make explicit cause-effect relationships and feedbacks between climatic, environmental, and human components in a socio-ecological system. The diagrams provide a clear way to visualise the structure of the system and identify how links between system variables combine to affect outcomes (such as the impact of a climate event on someone's livelihood). 

Let's build a simple causal loop diagram to illustrate how they work: 

#### Identify the problem variable

The first stage in building a causal loop diagram is picking a **problem or focus variable**. Typically, a problem variable should be something that relates to someone's well-being; an increase or decrease in the problem variable should cause a change in their well-being. Often, we're looking to design strategies or policies that affect problem variables to boost people's well-being or protect them from climate shocks or other harmful stressors. In this example, let's focus on *collecting crabs from the mangroves*. Mud crabs collected from the Ba Mangroves are sold in the local markets, which is an important source of income for many households. 

#### Identify the causes of the problem

After we have identified the problem variable, we need to identify **causes**. Causes affect the problem variable and the presence of a cause can result in an increase or decrease in the problem variable. Debris in small streams and channels in the mangroves can prevent people from accessing areas to collect mud crabs; thus, an increase in debris causes a decrease in mud crab collections. Debris in small streams and channels is our cause. As levels of debris directly affects people's ability to collect crabs, we say it is a **direct cause**. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-1.png" class="workshop-img-small">
</figure>

However, something else causes debris to build up in small streams and channels. Variables that cause a build up or decrease in debris are **indirect causes** of change in collections of mud crabs from the mangroves. They're indirect causes as they affect mud crab collections through another variable (the direct cause). In this example, a tropical cyclone is an indirect cause as the high winds associated with the storm can damage mangrove trees with fallen branches and trunks blocking streams. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-2.png" class="workshop-img-small">
</figure>

Tropical cyclones can also directly affect levels of mud crabs in the mangroves. The high winds and flooding associated with the storm can reduce numbers of mud crabs in the mangroves which directly affects the amount people can collect. Tropical cyclones are a direct and indirect cause of levels of mud crabs available for people to collect. This is an early example of how causal loop diagrams can capture complex linkages between components of a socio-ecological system. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-3.png" class="workshop-img">
</figure>

#### Identify the consequences of the problem

A consequence is a result of a change in the problem variable. As tropical cyclones cause a decrease in mud crab collections, people need to respond to secure food and income. If debris is blocking people's preferred locations to collect mud crabs they collect crabs at locations that are more accessible near their home. Changing location for collecting mud crabs is a **direct consequence**.

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-4.png" class="workshop-img">
</figure>

However, these more accessible locations for collecting mud crabs are not the best locations to collect crabs. This means people's catch is reduced and they need to find other ways to generate income. People do this by working as wage labourers on sugarcane fields. There are two things to note here. The first is that collecting crabs in sub-optimal locations links back to the problem variable of reducing levels of people's mud crab catch. The second is that tropical cyclone's causing a change in the problem variable, mud crab collections, causes people to collect crabs sub-optimal locations which reduces food and income. To compensate for this, people take on new income generating activities and work as wage labourers on sugarcane farms. This is an **indirect consequence** of tropical cyclones impacting mud crab collections. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-5.png" class="workshop-img">
</figure>

We have mentioned that people collect crabs to generate income; this is another **direct** consequence of collecting mud crabs. It is also a direct consequence of collecting mud crabs in other locations and wage labour activities on sugarcane farms. We can see that as mud collections decrease people will have less household income (i.e. they have fewer crabs to sell at the market). This, in turn, has a knock-on effect on people's household savings. If they have less income they will have less money to put into savings and they may need to draw on their savings to make up the shortfall. Change in people's savings is an indirect consequence of tropical cyclones affecting mud crab collections. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-6.png" class="workshop-img">
</figure>

#### Defining links between variables

We have started to create a system that describes how a tropical cyclone impacts people's capacity to collect crabs, which, in turn, affects other livelihood activities and their income. Cause-effect links between variables in the system are already shown on the diagram, what is missing is a description of the type of cause-effect link which is important for understanding the dynamics of a system and how the effects of a cause (e.g. a tropical cyclone) propagate through the system affecting people and ecosystems. 

Before we describe the links, there is one obvious link that is missing on our diagram. Tropical cyclones can affect sugarcane fields through flooding and waterlogging, which will also reduce sugarcane income. 

<figure style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/cld-demo-7.png" class="workshop-img">
</figure>

There are two types of links between variables in a causal loop diagram:

* **positive links** - the causal and affected variable change in the same direction. If the cause increases then the affected variable increases. If the cause decreases then the affected variable decreases. For example, an increase in crab collections causes an increase in income. 
* **negative links** - the causal and affected variable change in opposite directions. If the cause increases then the affected variable decreases. If the cause decreases then the affected variable increases. For example, an increase in tropical cyclone intensity or occurrence causes a decrease in mud crab collections. 

Let's add `+` or `-` signs to the links on the diagram to denote positive or negative links between system variables.

  <summary><b>Why is the link between collecting mud crabs and household income positive?</b></summary>

#### Feedback loops

When links between variables form circles feedback loops form in the system depicted in the causal loop diagram. There are two types of feedback loops:

* **reinforcing loop:** this occurs when a change in a causal variable propagates through the system to reinforce the initial change in the cause. Reinforcing loops occur when two positive links or two negative links form a loop. 
* **balancing loop:** this occurs when a change in a causal variable propagates through the system and causing an opposite change in the initial cause. Balancing loops occur when one negative and one positive links form a loop.

There's one loop in our simple causal loop diagram describing the mud crab collection system. The loop is formed by the two negative links between collecting mud crabs and collecting mud crabs in new locations. An increase in mud crab collections causes a decrease in collecting mud crabs in new locations. This decrease in collecting mud crabs in new (sub-optimal) locations results in an increase in mud crab collections. This, in turn, means people don't need to collect mud crabs in a new location. And so on. This is a reinforcing feedback loop. However, we can see how a tropical cyclone can change the system dynamics and create reinforcing feedback loop of decreasing mud crab collections. A tropical cyclone reduces mud crab collections, which causes people to collect mud crabs in sub-optimal locations, which reduces mud crab collections, which causes people to continue collecting mud crabs in other sub-optimal locations, and so on. 

Causal loop diagrams can provide a deeper and more complete understanding of the impact of external shocks, such as a climatic event or a policy intervention, by highlighting how their effects are amplified or attenuated by feedback loops. Identifying the presence of these feedback loops can highlight how resilient a system is to climate shocks and illustrate unforeseen consequences of policy interventions or adaptation strategies.

# Activity 4: Creating Causal Loop Diagrams

Following the tasks below, you will create a causal loop diagram that depicts how a problem variable affects poeple's livelihoods. You will then use this causal loop diagram to undertake two analyses:

1. Identify the cause-effect chains that explain how climatic shocks affect the problem variable, and, subsequently, people's livelihoods. 
2. Use the causal loop diagram to design an adaptation strategy or policy that reduces the negative impacts of climate shocks affecting your problem variable. 

**TASK 1: Select a problem variable**

In Activity 1 you made a list of landscape components and ecosystem services that people use to support their livelihoods. Pick one of the items on this list as a problem variable. Think carefully about how you select this variable. The goal of this task is to use a causal loop diagram to design an adaptation strategy that reduces climate impacts on livelihoods. You should look to select a variable that is important for someone's livelihood and is sensitive to climate shocks. 

In the middle of a sheet of paper write down your problem variable. 

**TASK 2: Identify causes**

In Activity 2 you made a list of climatic events that affect landscape components and ecosystem services that support people's livelihoods. Identify the climate events that **directly cause** changes in your problem variable (i.e. the climate event does NOT causea a change in the problem variable indirectly through another variable). If crop production is your problem variable, an example of direct climate causes could be flooding or heat events damaging crops in fields.

Use a different coloured pen, and to the left of your problem variable, write down the direct climate causes on your sheet of paper. Draw arrows that link climate causes to the problem variable. 

It is possible that climate events can indirectly affect your problem variable. Look at the notes you made in Activity 1 and Activity 2 to see if you can spot cases where a climate event causes a change in another variable, and the change in that variable causes a change in your problem variable. These are cases when climate events are **indirect causes**. An example could be flooding damaging farm machinery or roads which makes it harder to harvest crops, which impacts crop production.

Staying on the left side of your diagram, add these causal chains where climate events are indirect causes. Draw arrows that link climate causes indirectly to the problem variable.
